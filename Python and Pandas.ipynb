    "* Is a high-level interpreted general purpose programming language named after the Monty Python British comedy troupe\n",
    "* Was created by Guido van Rossum, and is maintained by an open source community\n",
    "* Is the fifth most popular programming language\n",
    "* Is an object orientied language\n",
    "* Is use mostly in data science because it is powerful and fast, and is compatible with other languages\n",
    "* Runs everywhere, it's easy to learn, it's highly readable, open-source and its fast development time compared to other languages\n",
    "* Comes with a growing and always-improving list of open-source libraries for scientific programming, data manipulation, and data analysis (e.g., Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PyTables, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython/Jupyter\n",
    "* Is an enhanced, interactive python interpreter that started as a grad school project by Fernando Perez. \n",
    "* Evolved into the IPython notebook, which allowed users to archive their code, figures, and analysis in a single document, making doing reproducible research and sharing said research much easier. \n",
    "* Other languages including but not limited to Julia, Python and R were included. This then led to a rebranding known as the Jupyter Project. "
