    "- **database**: a database is a collection of data about entities. It can be more or less structured, depending on the type of database, and can include information about the relationships between entities.\n",
    "- **database management system (DBMS)**: DBMS is a system that provides infrastructure for storing, managing and interacting with databases. It generally includes 3 elements: how to store data, a query language, support for transactions and crash recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, in a **_relational database management system (RDBMS)_**, or relational database, data records are stored in **_tables_**, each of which:\n",
    "\n",
    "- has a predefined set of **_columns_** - the pieces of information captured for each record in a table.\n",
    "- stores data records as **_rows_** in the table, where each row has a place to store a value for every column in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables, including their columns, column types and relationships with other tables, are defined in a database **_schema_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When tables contain a **_primary key_**, one or more columns that uniquely identify each row in a given table, rows in one table can also be explicitly related to rows in other tables through **_foreign key_** columns that hold the primary key of the related row.\n",
